## Portefeuille

### What is 'portefeuille'?

 The portfolio of Patrik Affentranger, a professional Web Publisher from Switzerland based in Perth, Western Australia.

 The repository contains my personal online portfolio, which can also be seen at [http://portfolio.patrikaffentranger.me](http://portfolio.patrikaffentranger.me).

 It's written in [Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com).


### What does it do?

 The idea of *portefeuille* is simple. To provide an easy-to-use website template for web professionals. Anyone can fork my template, swap the text, change links and pictures and voilà, an online portfolio.


### Compability

 To make *portefeuille* work seamlessly you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com) installed.


### Collaboration

 Please feel free to fork and use *portefeuille*. If there is a problem, please open up an issue or send me a pull request.

 For now, *portefeuille* is provided as is. I haven't had the time to test every little detail in all the browsers/devices.
 Looking forward to get some feedback.


### Future of portefeuille
