## Portefeuille

1. **What is 'portefeuille'?**

 The portfolio of Patrik Affentranger, a professional Web Publisher from Switzerland based in Perth, Western Australia.

 The repository contains my personal online portfolio, which can also be seen at [http://patrikaffentranger.me](http://patrikaffentranger.me).

 It's written in **HTML**/[Jade](http://github.com/visionmade/jade) and **CSS**/[LESS](http://github.com/cloudhead/less.js).


2. **What does it do?**

 The idea of *portefeuille* is simple. To provide an easy-to-use website template for web professionals. Anyone can fork my template, swap the text, change links and pictures and voilà, an online portfolio.


3. **Compability**

 To make *portefeuille* work seamlessly you will need CodeKit (Mac OSX) or LiveReload (Windows). There are also plenty of other tools which can convert Jade or LESS files, I am sure. However, my preferred tool is CodeKit.
 
 If that's cool with you, please clone the repository or download the zip and place it into your wwwroot folder.


4. **Collaboration**

 Please feel free to fork and use *portefeuille*. If there is a problem, please let me know or send me a pull request.
 
 For now, *portefeuille* is provided as is. I haven't had the time to test every little detail in all the browsers/devices. Looking forward to get some feedback.
